<h3>1. Start-up</h3>
<p>The best best Korean series I've seen so far. It gives sadness, sorrow, nostalgia, and everything combines really well.</p>

<h3>2. The Good Bad Mother</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Korean drama. It makes my eyes swelling all the time watching it.</p>

<h3>3. Twenty Five Twenty One </h3>
<p>Another really cool series that appear on Netflix. This one also gave me the wonderful feeling and all.</p>
